## Prototype Coding Exercise
Given the definitions shown in code, you are asked to implement `Line.deep_copy()`  to perform a deep copy of the given `Line`  object. This method should return a copy of a Line that contains copies of its start/end points.

*Note*: please do not confuse `deep_copy()` with `__deepcopy__()`!
