## Decorator Coding Exercise
You are given two types, Circle and Square, and a decorator called ColoredShape.

The decorator adds the color to the string output for a given shape, just as we did in the lecture.

There's a trick though: the decorator now has a resize() method that should resize the underlying shape. However, only the Circle has a resize() method; the Square does not â€” do not add it!

You are asked to complete the implementation of Circle, Square and ColoredShape.

Here is a sample unit test that should pass:

```py
class Evaluate(TestCase):
  def test_circle(self):
    circle = ColoredShape(Circle(5), 'red')
    self.assertEqual(
      'A circle of radius 5 has the color red',
      str(circle)
    )
    circle.resize(2)
    self.assertEqual(
      'A circle of radius 10 has the color red',
      str(circle)
    )
```
