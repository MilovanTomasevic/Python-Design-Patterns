## Proxy Coding Exercise
You are given the `Person`  class and asked to write a `ResponsiblePerson`  proxy that does the following:

- Allows person to drink unless they are younger than 18 (in that case, return "too young")
- Allows person to drive unless they are younger than 16 (otherwise, "too young")
- In case of driving while drink, returns "dead", regardless of age
