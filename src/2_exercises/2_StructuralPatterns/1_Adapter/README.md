## Adapter Coding Exercise
You are given a class called `Square` and a function `calculate_area()` which calculates the area of a given rectangle.

In order to use Square in calculate_area, instead of augmenting it with width/height members, please implement the `SquareToRectangleAdapter` class. This adapter takes a square and adapts it in such a way that it can be used as an argument to `calculate_area()`.
